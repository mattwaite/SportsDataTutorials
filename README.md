# LearnR Sports Data Tutorials

Interactive R tutorials for SPMC350 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's College of Journalism and Mass Communications. 

To get them started, you need to do the following:

1. Install the latest version of R on your computer (a recent version will do if you already have it installed).
2. Install the latest version of R Studio.
3. Then, in the console of R Studio, run the following command: 

`install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rmarkdown", "lubridate", "janitor", "cowplot", "learnr", "wehoop", "worldfootballR", "remotes", "devtools", "waffle", "ggrepel", "ggbeeswarm", "ggbump", "ggalt", "ggtext", "rvest", "Hmisc", "cluster"))`

4. After that finishes, run the following command:

`devtools::install_github("mattwaite/SportsDataTutorials")`

If you are prompted that newer versions exist, decline to install them.
