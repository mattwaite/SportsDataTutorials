## The Goal

The goal of this lesson is to teach you how to apply professional finishing touches to your sports data visualizations, elevating them from basic charts to publication-ready graphics. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to refine your ggplot2 charts with custom themes, appropriate font sizes, and strategic use of white space. You'll learn to adjust title positions, modify grid lines, and fine-tune text elements to create a visual hierarchy that guides the reader's eye. We'll also cover special considerations for waffle charts and how to properly label multi-chart visualizations. Additionally, you'll understand the importance of consistent styling across your graphics and how to implement code folding in your blog posts. These skills will help you create polished, professional-looking visualizations that effectively communicate your sports analytics insights and enhance the overall quality of your blog.

## The Basics

The output from ggplot is good, but not great. We need to add some pieces to it. The elements of a good graphic are:

* Headline
* Chatter
* The main body
* Annotations
* Labels
* Source line
* Credit line

That looks like:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/chartannotated.png"))
```

Let's explore fixing up ggplot's output. We'll need a graphic to work with first, so I'm going to use a bubble chart. 

```{r text-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

      grepl("L", Outcome) ~ 0)

The first thing you should do with any chart that isn't a waffle chart -- more on that later -- is remove the default plot look and grey backgound by adding a pre-defined theme. There are two you should use to clean your charts up: `theme_minimal` or `theme_light`. These pre-packaged themes do just that. They make your chart cleaner and easier to read in one swoop. 

**NOTE**: Adding a `theme()` is something you do last. And if you're going to change theme elements, you need to **apply your prepackaged theme first**, then do your theme customization. Everything in ggplot is rendered in order. If you do custom theming, THEN apply the prepackaged theme, the prepackaged theme will overwrite anything you did. So `theme_minimal()` or `theme_light()` comes first.

Scroll down here and find the theme_minimal() at the very end. We're just adding it on, like any other part of ggplot.

```{r bubble7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "text-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() +

Compare that to your previous chart. Easier to read, right?

We're off to a good start, but our text has no real hierarchy. We want our headline to stand out more. So let's change that. When it comes to changing text, the place to do that is in the theme element. [There are a lot of ways to modify the theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html). 

We'll start easy. Let's make the headline bigger and bold. Scroll down here under theme_minimal and you'll see what I've done.

```{r bubble8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "text-load-data", message=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=ypp, 
    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), 
    color="grey", 
    alpha=.3) + 
  geom_point(
    data=bigten, 
    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), 
    color="red") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.863151) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.448228) +
  geom_text(aes(x=7, y=4.2, label="Good Offense, Good Defense"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=5, y=6.6, label="Bad Defense, Bad Offense"), color="blue") +
  geom_text_repel(
    data=bigten, 
    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team)
  ) + 
  labs(
    x="Offensive yards per play", 
    y="Defensive yards per play", 
    title="Nebraska was good, except where it mattered", 
    subtitle="The Huskers offense and defense, on a per play basis, were among the elite in the sport.", 
    caption="Source: Data Provider | By Your Name"
    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold")
    ) 
```
```{r bubble8-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=ypp, 
    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), 
    color="grey", 
    alpha=.3) + 
  geom_point(
    data=bigten, 
    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), 
    color="red") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.863151) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.448228) +
  geom_text(aes(x=7, y=4.2, label="Good Offense, Good Defense"), color="blue") +
  geom_text(aes(x=5, y=6.6, label="Bad Defense, Bad Offense"), color="blue") +
  geom_text_repel(
    data=bigten,

  labs(
    x="Offensive yards per play", 
    y="Defensive yards per play", 
    title="Nebraska was good, except where it mattered",

    caption="Source: Data Provider | By Your Name"
    ) +

  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold")
    ) 
```

Now let's fix a few other things -- like the axis labels being too big, the subtitle could be smaller and lets drop some grid lines. Scroll down and take a look. 

```{r bubble9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "text-load-data", message=FALSE}

    ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),

    ) 
```
```{r bubble9-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}

    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    ) 
```
```{r bubble9-check}

```
One last thing: ggplot, by default, sets the margin for the title and subtitle to the edge of the chart area -- the area were the data appears. It creates an odd spacing where the title is shifted right for little reason. We can fix that too in `theme()`.

## Waffle charts require special attention

Frequently in my classes, students use the waffle charts library quite extensively to make graphics. This is a quick walkthough on how to get a waffle chart into a publication ready state. 

Let's look go back to the Nebraska vs Michigan State waffle chart we did in the waffle tutorial. 

```{r waffle-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nu <- c("Rushing"=187, "Passing"=255)
ms <- c("Rushing"=71, "Passing"=183, 188)
```

We can add labels and themes, but you have to be careful. The waffle library is applying it's own theme -- like theme_minimal -- but if we override something they are using in their theme, some things that are hidden come back and make it worse. So here is an example of how to use ggplot's `labs` and the `theme` to make a fully publication ready graphic. They just get added with a + after the waffle.

```{r waffle1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "waffle-load-data", message=FALSE}
waffle(
        nu, 
        rows = 10, 
        colors = c("black", "red")
) +
  labs(
    x = "1 square = 1 yard",
    title="Nebraska rolled up yards on offense", 
    subtitle="The Huskers had a good night throwing and running.",
    caption="Source: NCAA | Graphic by Matt Waite") + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
```
```{r waffle1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
waffle(
        nu, 
        rows = 10, 
        colors = c("black", "red")
) +
  labs(
    x = "1 square = 1 yard",
    title="Nebraska rolled up yards on offense", 
    subtitle="The Huskers had a good night throwing and running.",
    caption="Source: NCAA | Graphic by Matt Waite") + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
```
```{r waffle1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

But what if we're using a waffle iron? It gets tougher. 

Here is a full example. I start with my waffle iron code, but note that each waffle is pretty much a self contained thing. That's because a waffle iron isn't really a thing. It's just a way to group waffles together, so you have to make each waffle individually. My first waffle has the title and subtitle and the x-axis label is the team -- Nebraska. The bottom one has no title or subtitle but it does have the caption and the axis label has a little trick to add a return into the label, so I get both the team and the unit in there. 

```{r waffle2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "waffle-load-data", message=FALSE}
iron(
 waffle(
   nu, 
   rows = 10, 
   colors = c("black", "red", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x="Nebraska",
     title="Nebraska vs Michigan State: By the numbers", 
     subtitle="The Huskers won everywhere except the scoreboard.") + 
   theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ),
 waffle(
   ms, 
   rows = 10, 
   colors = c("black", "dark green", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x = "Michigan State\n1 square = 10 yards",
     caption="Source: NCAA | Graphic by Matt Waite"
     )
) 
```
```{r waffle2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
iron(
 waffle(
   nu, 
   rows = 10, 
   colors = c("black", "red", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x="Nebraska",
     title="Nebraska vs Michigan State: By the numbers", 
     subtitle="The Huskers won everywhere except the scoreboard.") + 
   theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ),
 waffle(
   ms, 
   rows = 10, 
   colors = c("black", "dark green", "white")) + 
   labs(
     x = "Michigan State\n1 square = 10 yards",
     caption="Source: NCAA | Graphic by Matt Waite"
     )
) 
```
```{r waffle2-check}

```

Note: These finishing touches aren't optional. They're required of every graphic you create for this course.

## One last finishing touch

In your blog post, in your yaml header, you must have the `code-fold: true` bits from the blogging tutorial. If it's missing, you lose points. 

## The Recap

In this lesson, we've explored the crucial final steps in creating professional-quality sports data visualizations. We started by reviewing the essential elements of a good graphic, including headlines, chatter, annotations, and source lines. We then delved into practical techniques for refining ggplot2 charts, such as applying theme_minimal() to create a clean base, customizing text elements for better visual hierarchy, and adjusting margins for improved layout. We learned how to strategically modify grid lines and axis labels to enhance readability without cluttering the visualization. Special attention was given to waffle charts, demonstrating how to add appropriate labels and themes while working within the constraints of the waffle library. We also covered the nuances of styling multi-chart visualizations using waffle irons. Throughout the lesson, we emphasized the importance of consistent styling and the necessity of including these finishing touches in all graphics for this course. Finally, we highlighted the requirement of implementing code folding in blog posts, ensuring that your visualizations are not only visually appealing but also presented in a professional, interactive format. These skills will set your sports analytics blog apart, demonstrating a level of polish and attention to detail that marks the transition from amateur to professional-quality data visualization.

## Terms to Know

- `theme_minimal()`: A ggplot2 function that applies a clean, minimalist theme to charts, removing unnecessary visual elements.
- `theme()`: A ggplot2 function used to customize various aspects of a plot's appearance, including text, lines, and backgrounds.
- `element_text()`: A function used within theme() to specify text properties such as size, color, and font face.
- `plot.title.position`: A theme element that controls the alignment of the plot title, often set to "plot" for left alignment.
- `panel.grid.minor`: A theme element used to control the appearance of minor grid lines in a plot.
- `labs()`: A ggplot2 function used to add or modify plot labels, including title, subtitle, and axis labels.
- `code-fold`: A YAML header option in Quarto documents that allows readers to show or hide code chunks in the final output.
- Visual Hierarchy: The arrangement of graphic elements to show their order of importance, guiding the viewer's attention through the visualization.
