# Z-scores

## The basics

Z-scores are a handy way to standardize numbers so you can compare things across groupings or time. In this class, we may want to compare teams by year, or era. We can use z-scores to answer questions like who was the greatest X of all time, because a z-score can put them in context to their era. 

A z-score is a measure of how far a particular stat is from the mean. It's measured in standard deviations from that mean. A standard deviation is a measure of how much variation -- how spread out -- numbers are in a data set. What it means here, with regards to z-scores, is that zero is perfectly average. If it's 1, it's one standard deviation above the mean, and 34 percent of all cases are between 0 and 1. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/simulations2.png"))
```

If you think of the normal distribution, it means that 84.3 percent of all case are below that 1. If it were -1, it would mean the number is one standard deviation below the mean, and 84.3 percent of cases would be above that -1. So if you have numbers with z-scores of 3 or even 4, that means that number is waaaaaay above the mean.  

So let's use 2021's Nebraska volleyball team, which if you weren't paying attention, was very good at volleyball. A few points from legendary. But were they the best Husker team since 2018, when they were also the national semifinalist? 

## Calculating a Z score in R

For this we'll need the season totals for the last four seasons. **For purposes of this exercise, you don't need to do this. The data is included here if you want to try this in your own notebook.**

```{r echo=FALSE, class.output="bg-info", results="asis",  message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)
library(glue)

dllink <- download_link(
  link = "http://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/volleyball1822.csv",
  button_label = "Download csv file",
  button_type = "danger",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = FALSE
)

glue("<pre><p><strong>For this walkthrough:</strong></p><p>{dllink}</p></pre>")

```

Load the tidyverse.

```{r load-tidyverse, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-solution}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-check}
grade_this_code()
```

And load the data.

```{r zscore-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE}
seasons <- read_csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/volleyball1822.csv")

perset <- seasons %>% 
  mutate(
    killsperset = Kills/S,
    digsperset = Digs/S,
    acesperset = Aces/S
  ) %>%
  select(Season, Team, Conference, killsperset, digsperset, acesperset)

teamzscore <- perset %>%
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  mutate(
    killszscore = as.numeric(scale(killsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    aceszscore = as.numeric(scale(acesperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    digszscore = as.numeric(scale(digsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    TotalZscore = killszscore + aceszscore + digszscore
  ) %>% ungroup() 
```
```{r zscore-load-data-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
seasons <- read_csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/volleyball1822.csv")
```
```{r zscore-load-data-exercise-solution}
seasons <- read_csv("http://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/volleyball1822.csv")
```
```{r zscore-load-data-exercise-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Let's `glimpse` the data and see what we've got. 

```{r glimpse-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
glimpse(seasons)
```
```{r glimpse-data-solution}
glimpse(seasons)
```
```{r glimpse-data-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 1: Preparing data

The first thing we need to do is create some metrics to deal with comparing seasons that include the covid season. Then we'll select some fields we think represent team quality and a few things to help us keep things straight. 

Every team plays a different number of sets in a season, and really great teams and really bad teams will play fewer sets than middle of the road teams. And, with the covid season, some teams got just a few matches in, others got more. To be able to work with this, we need to standardize around *per set* metrics. Sets in our data are marked as S. 

To get that, we're going to use mutate to create `killsperset`, `digsperset` and `acesperset`. Then, we're going to use select to get Season, Institution, Conference and our four metrics. 

```{r zscore2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
perset <- seasons %>% 
  mutate(
    killsperset = ?????/?,
    digsperset = ????/?,
    acesperset = ????/?
  ) %>%
  select(Season, Team, Conference, ???????????, ??????????, ??????????)
```
```{r zscore2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
perset <- seasons %>% 
  mutate(
    killsperset = Kills/S,
    digsperset = Digs/S,
    acesperset = Aces/S
  ) %>%
  select(Season, Team, Conference, killsperset, digsperset, acesperset)
```
```{r zscore2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

## Exercise 2: Create a z-score

The first thing we're going to do is deal with having multiple seasons. We want the z-score to be centered on the average for *that season*, so each Husker team gets ranked against their competition, not all teams in all seasons. That way, we compare how good the 2018 Huskers were compared to 2018 teams, vs 2021 teams, which is impossible. A team from 2018 can't play a team from 2020. How do we make z-scores for each season? Simple: group by. 

Then, we're *NOT* going to use summarize. We'll use mutate. That has the effect of putting all the 2020 teams together in a pile, calculating each teams z-score and then just leaving it there instead of folding it all together into a single number (like summarize would). 

To calculate a z-score in R, the easiest way is to use the `scale` function in base R. To use it, you use `scale(FieldName, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)`. The center and scale indicate if you want to subtract from the mean and if you want to divide by the standard deviation, respectively. We do.

When we have multiple z-scores, it's pretty standard practice to add them together into a composite score. That's what we're doing at the end here with `TotalZscore`. 

```{r zscore3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
teamzscore <- perset %>%
  group_by(??????) %>% 
  mutate(
    killszscore = as.numeric(scale(?????perset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    aceszscore = as.numeric(scale(????perset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    digszscore = as.numeric(scale(????perset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    TotalZscore = ?????zscore + ????zscore + ????zscore
  ) %>% ungroup() 
```
```{r zscore3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
teamzscore <- perset %>%
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  mutate(
    killszscore = as.numeric(scale(killsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    aceszscore = as.numeric(scale(acesperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    digszscore = as.numeric(scale(digsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    TotalZscore = killszscore + aceszscore + digszscore
  ) %>% ungroup() 
```
```{r zscore3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

So now we have a dataframe called `teamzscore` that has 353 basketball teams with Z scores. What does it look like? 

```{r head-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
head(teamzscore)
```
```{r head-data-solution}
head(teamzscore)
```
```{r head-data-check}
grade_this_code()
```

A way to interpret this data -- a team at zero is precisely average. The larger the positive number, the more exceptional they are. The larger the negative number, the more truly terrible they are. 

### Exercise 3: Arrange to the rescue

So who were the best teams in the country last season? Arrange can tell us. We just made a composite z-score -- a total if you will. Let's use that in arrange to see who is the best by our measure.

```{r zscore4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
teamzscore %>% arrange(desc(???????????))
```
```{r zscore4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
teamzscore %>% arrange(desc(TotalZscore))
```
```{r zscore4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

And the greatest volleyball team in the last four years is ... wait what? 

So we have some work to do here if this is the answer we're getting, but what if we look a little closer. 

### Exercise 4: Filtering to see Nebraska

Closer to home, how is Nebraska doing vs the Big Ten? Because we included Conference in our select, we can add a filter for the Big Ten before our arrange and get an answer. 

```{r zscore5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
teamzscore %>% 
  filter(Conference == "??? ???") %>% 
  arrange(desc(???????????)) %>%
  select(Season, Team, TotalZscore)
```
```{r zscore5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
teamzscore %>% 
  filter(Conference == "Big Ten") %>% 
  arrange(desc(TotalZscore)) %>%
  select(Season, Team, TotalZscore)
```
```{r zscore5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

So, as we can see, with our composite Z Score, the best Big Ten volleyball since 2018 isn't Nebraska, a two-time national semi-finalist. It isn't Wisconsin who won the natty last year and was a finalist in 2019. It's ... Minnesota? Interesting.

That said, the 2021 Husker team is a bit better than the 2018 team, though each ended just short of a title. 

## Writing about z-scores

The great thing about z-scores is that they make it very easy for you, the sports analyst, to create your own measures of who is better than who. The downside: Only a small handful of sports fans know what the hell a z-score is. 

As such, you should try as hard as you can to avoid writing about them. 

If the word z-score appears in your story or in a chart, you need to explain what it is. "The ranking uses a statistical measure of the distance from the mean called a z-score" is a good way to go about it. You don't need a full stats textbook definition, just a quick explanation. And keep it simple. 

**Never use z-score in a headline.** Write around it. Away from it. Z-score in a headline is attention repellent. You won't get anyone to look at it. So "Tottenham tops in z-score" bad, "Tottenham tops in the Premiere League" good.
