<h2>The basics of the basics</h2>
<p>R is a programming language, one specifically geared toward
statistical analysis. Like all programming languages, it has certain
built-in functions and you can interact with it in multiple ways. The
first, and most basic, is the console. Think of the console like talking
directly to R. It’s direct, but it has some drawbacks and some quirks
we’ll get into later.</p>
<p>For now, we’re going to use windows in this page like console
windows. You’ll type commands into the boxes below and hit the Run Code
button on the top right of the box. Be sure that you’re reading closely
– things like spaces, capitalization and spelling all matter. Some
things matter to the point that if you miss them, the code won’t work.
Other things are stylistic. It takes time and practice to know the
difference.</p>
<p>To be clear: <strong>Everyone makes mistakes</strong>.
<strong>Everyone makes dumb mistakes</strong>. Everyone overlooks dumb
mistakes for hours only to be shown the missing comma. <strong>You
aren’t dumb</strong>. You’re like every single person who has ever tried
to learn how to code.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult hurdles for beginning students of
mathematics to get over is notation. If you miss a day, tune out for a
class, or just never get around to asking what something means, you’ll
be lost. So lets just cover some bases and make sure we all understand
some ultra-basic notation.</p>
<p>You might laugh at these, but someone reading them is looking up Gods
on Wikipedia to thank. So do yourself a favor and refresh.</p>

<p>One of the most important and often overlooked concepts in basic math
is the order that you do the calculations. When you have something like
<code>5+5*5^2</code>, which gets done first?</p>
<p>In math, and in code, order matters. If you must do A before you do
B, then A needs to appear before and run before B. So you need to keep
track of when things happen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, math teachers have provided us an easy to remember
mnemonic that you probably learned in sixth grade and tried to forget
until now.</p>
<p><strong>PEMDAS</strong> – <strong>P</strong>arenthesis,
<strong>E</strong>xponents, <strong>M</strong>ultiplication,
<strong>D</strong>ivision, <strong>A</strong>ddition,
<strong>S</strong>ubtraction</p>
<p>What that means is when you look at a mathematical formula, you do
the calculations in the order PEMDAS tells you. Something in
parenthesis? Do that first. Is there an exponent? Do that next.
Multiplication or division? It’s next and so forth. Knowing PEMDAS will
save you from stupid mistakes down the road.</p>

<p>Congrats, you’ve run some code. It’s not very complex, and you knew

<div id="section-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>So we’ve learned that we can compute things. We can also store
things. <strong>In programming languages, these are called
variables</strong>. We can assign things to variables using
<code>&lt;-</code>. And then we can do things with them. <strong>The
<code>&lt;-</code> is a called an assignment operator</strong>.</p>
<p>With variables, we can assign names to values. Let’s try it.</p>
<div id="section-exercise-2-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 2: Variables</h3>
<p>One of the key concepts of programming that you’ll need to learn is
that most things are a pattern. You’ll see that doing certain things
takes the same form each time, and all you’re doing is changing small
parts of the pattern to fit what you want to do.</p>
<p>Declaring variables is a pattern. The pattern here is
<code>Name Of The Thing &lt;- Value Of The Thing</code>.</p>
<p>Names can be anything you want them to be, but they have to be one
word, and it’s better if they have no numbers or symbols in it. So you
can create a variable called
NebraskaWillWinTheNationalTitleThisSeasonMattRhuleIsGod if you want. But
some questions for you: What is that variable going to contain? Is it
obvious by the name? And do you want to try and type that again? How
about three more times? Yeah, me neither.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5 Rules For Naming Variables</strong><br> 1. One word, no
spaces.<br> 2. If you must use a number, it has to be at the end, never
at the beginning.<br> 3. No symbols (like ! or ? or # or anything like
it).<br> 4. Keep them short, but never one letter. If your variable is
holding the number of touchdowns a team scored, don’t call it t.<br> 5.
Make them understandable. If your variable is holding the number of
touchdowns a teams scored, call it touchdowns. Keep it simple.<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next thing we need to know about are the values. There’s a bunch
of different kinds of values, but two that we’re going to work with the
most are <strong>strings</strong> and <strong>numbers</strong>. A string
is just text. Your name is a string. Your home address is a string. For
the most part, strings aren’t hard – they’re anything you wouldn’t do
math on. So, for example, your phone number is a string, even though
it’s made up of numbers. If we add your phone number to mine, do we get
something meaningful? No. Same with ZIP codes. They’re strings.</p>
<p><strong>To record a string, you put it in quotes.</strong> So
<code>myname &lt;- "Matt"</code> is how to set the value of the variable
myname to Matt.</p>
<p><strong>To record a number, do <em>not</em> use quotes.</strong> So
<code>myage &lt;- 46</code> is how to set the value of the variable
myage to 46.</p>
<p>Where this becomes a problem is where you try to make a string into a
number or try to do math with strings.</p>
<p>In the window below, create two variables called Number1 and Number2.
Set Number1 to 5 and Number2 to “5” with the quotes. Then try adding
Number1 + Number2. What happens?</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise" data-label="intentional-error-one"
data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1"
data-lines="0">
<script type="application/json" data-ui-opts="1">{"engine":"r","has_checker":false,"caption":"<span data-i18n=\"text.enginecap\" data-i18n-opts=\"{&quot;engine&quot;:&quot;R&quot;}\">R Code<\/span>"}</script>
</div>
<p>You get an error.
<code>non-numeric argument to binary operator</code> is a rather
computer-ish way of saying you tried to add 5 and Zebra. You can’t add
those two things together. So when you see that error, the non-numeric
part is your hint that you’re trying to do math on something that isn’t
a number. To fix it, just remove the quotes.</p>
<p>Let’s do something more real and calculate the number of home runs
per game the Nebraska baseball team hit this season. To do this, we need
to know the number of home runs the team hit and the number of games
they played. Then it’s just simple division.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.huskers.com/Baseball/2023/teamcume.htm">You
can find season stats here</a> at the bottom of the table in a row
labeled Totals. The number of games is in the column named GP-GS, which
stands for Games Played - Games Started. See why naming things what they
are is a rule in this class?</p>
<p>We’re going to name the first variable HomeRuns and the second
variable Games. <strong>Pay Attention: HomeRuns, not Home Runs. The
space will break it.</strong> Set them equal to the numbers you got from
the table, then divide HomeRuns by Games.</p>
<p><em>Write the code necessary to create the variables and set it to
the number of home runs Nebraska hit in the 2023 season and the number
of games played.</em></p>

</div>
<p>Looking at our ouput, we can read that as the Huskers hit 1.7 home
runs per game this past season. So if you watched a game, chances are
you were going to see the Good Guys hit at least one bomb, and a good
chance you’d see 2. Some days you’d get less, some days you get more,
but on average, they hit just about 1.7 per game.</p>
<p>This isn’t terribly useful just yet. If we wanted to know where the
Huskers ranked in college baseball, it would take us forever to look up
every team and do this math. But as you now know, variables can hold
anything we want to store in them. Soon enough, that HomeRuns value will
hold every team in college baseball, and Games will hold the games that
every team played. The code doesn’t change all that much, but we need to
crawl before we walk.</p>

<div id="section-notebooks" class="section level2">
<h2>Notebooks</h2>
<p>Outside of these tutorials, you will work in notebooks. Notebooks are
a place where we can combine text, where we explain our thinking, with
code, where we do our work. Modern data science requires transparency.
Notebooks are where we are transparent. Here is my data, here is my
code, here is my thinking, you can see it all and judge for
yourself.</p>
<p>To make a notebook, go up to the top left of your R Studio window and
you’ll see a green plus sign. Click that, and go down to R Notebook. Or,
you can go to the File menu and go to New File and then to R
Notebook.</p>
<p><img src="images/basics1.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>You’ll notice, in your notebook, a lot of automatically generated
text. We do not want that. So you’ll need to select it all - command A
on a Mac, control A on Windows - and hit delete. You should have a blank
page now.</p>
<p>Text – explanations – go between code chunks. So At first, just write
a sentence.</p>
<p>Then, you can click the green C in the tool bar and go to R or use
the keyboard shortcut to add a chunk: Ctrl + Alt + I on Windows or
Command + Option + I on Mac.</p>
<p><img src="images/basics2.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>Then, it’s simply a matter of putting things where they need to
go.</p>
<p><img src="images/basics3.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>When it’s time to turn it in, you just go to File &gt; Save and give
the file a name and save it. When asked, you’re turning in the .Rmd file
you just saved.
