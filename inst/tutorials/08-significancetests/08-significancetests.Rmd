# Significance tests

## The basics

Now that we've worked with data a little, it's time to start asking more probing questions of our data. One of the most probing questions we can ask -- one that so few sports journalists ask -- is if the difference between this thing and the normal thing is real. 

We had a perfect natural experiment going on in sports to show how significance tests work. The NBA in 2021, to salvage a season and get to the playoffs, put their players in a bubble -- more accurately a hotel complex at Disney World in Orlando -- and had them play games without fans. 

So are the games different from other regular season games that had fans? 

To answer this, we need to understand that a significance test is a way to determine if two numbers are *significantly* different from each other. Generally speaking, we're asking if a subset of data -- a sample -- is different from the total data pool -- the population. Typically, this relies on data being in a normal distribution.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/simulations2.png"))
```

If it is, then we know certain things about it. Like the mean -- the average -- will be a line right at the peak of cases. And that 66 percent of cases will be in that red area -- the first standard deviation. 

A significance test will determine if a sample taken from that group is different from the total.

Significance testing involves stating a hypothesis. In our case, our hypothesis is that there is a difference between bubble games without people and regular games with people. 

In statistics, the **null hypothesis** is the opposite of your hypothesis. In this case, that there is no difference between fans and no fans. 

What we're driving toward is a metric called a p-value, which is the probability that you'd get your sample mean *if the null hypothesis is true.* So in our case, it's the probability we'd see the numbers we get if there was no difference between fans and no fans. If that probability is below .05, then we consider the difference significant and we reject the null hypothesis.

So let's see. We'll need a log of every game in the covid NBA season. In this data, there's a field called COVID, which labels the game as a regular game or a bubble game. **For purposes of this exercise, you don't need to do this. The data is included here if you want to try this in your own notebook.**

```{r echo=FALSE, class.output="bg-info", results="asis",  message=FALSE,  warning=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)
library(glue)

dllink <- download_link(
  link = "https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/nbabubble.csv",
  button_label = "Download csv file",
  button_type = "danger",
  has_icon = TRUE,
  icon = "fa fa-save",
  self_contained = FALSE
)

glue("<pre><p><strong>For this walkthrough:</strong></p><p>{dllink}</p></pre>")

```

First we need some libraries. 

```{r load-tidyverse, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-solution}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-check}
grade_this_code()
```

And import the data.

```{r significance-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
logs <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/nbabubble.csv")
```
```{r significance-load-data-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
logs <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/nbabubble.csv")
```
```{r significance-load-data-exercise-solution}
logs <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/nbabubble.csv")
```
```{r significance-load-data-exercise-check}
grade_this_code()
```

As per usual, let's take a look at this with head.

```{r head-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "significance-load-data"}
head(____)
```
```{r head-data-solution}
head(logs)
```
```{r head-data-check}
grade_this_code()
```


### Exercise 1: Let's test.

First, let's just look at shooting Here's a theory: fans make players nervous. The screaming makes players tense up, and tension makes for bad shooting. An alternative to this: screaming fans make you defend harder. So my hypothesis is that not only is the shooting different, it's lower.

Typically speaking, with significance tests, the process involves creating two different means and then running a bunch of formulas on them. R makes this easy by giving you a `t.test` function, which does all the work for you. What we have to tell it is what is the value we are testing (hint: we're looking at team shooting percentage), what is our grouping label field (hint: look at the last sentence right before the box where you download the data), and from what data (hint: look at the loading data step).

```{r ttest1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "significance-load-data"}
t.test(____ ~ ____, data=____)
```
```{r ttest1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
t.test(TeamFGPCT ~ COVID, data=logs)
```
```{r ttest1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Now let's talk about the output. I prefer to read these bottom up. So at the bottom, it says that the mean field goal percentage in an NBA game With Fans is 46.08 percent. The mean scored in games Without Fans is 46.45 percent. That means teams about a third of a percent BETTER without fans on average. 

But, some games people can't miss, some games players couldn't make a bucket if the hoop was a hula hoop. We learned that averages can be skewed by extremes. So the next thing we need to look at is the **p-value**. Remember, this is the probability that we'd get this sample mean -- the without fans mean -- if there was no difference between fans and no fans. 

The probability? 0.3894 or 38.9 percent. That means in almost 4 in 10 times, we WOULD get this answer.

Remember, if the probability is below .05, then we determine that this number is statistically significant. We'll talk more about statistical significance soon, but in this case, statistical significance means that our hypothesis is correct: shooting percentages are different without fans than with. 

Except, our number is NOT lower than .05. It's considerably higher than that. That means our hypothesis is NOT correct and we have to *accept the null hypothesis.* 

We can safely say that professional basketball players shoot just as well with fans as without. So sit down and eat your popcorn.

## Rejecting the null hypothesis

So what does it look like when your hypothesis is correct? 

Let's test another thing that may have been impacted by bubble games: the refs. It's almost a feature of sports: Yelling at the refs when they make a call, good or bad. Amazing how often the goodness or badness of the call depends on who you are rooting for. 

My hypothesis is that without fans to yell at refs, they weren't calling fouls like they were when the fans were there to ... ahem ... encourage them to do their jobs.

### Exercise 2: Do people affect the referees?

First things first: We need to make a dataframe called refs where we'll add up the team and the opponent's personal fouls. This will tell is if the refs were more active with people or without. Will our t-test tell us it's significant?

```{r ttest2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "significance-load-data"}
____ <- logs |> mutate(totalfouls = ____ + ____)

t.test(____ ~ ____, data=____)
```
```{r ttest2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
refs <- logs |> mutate(totalfouls = TeamPersonalFouls + OpponentPersonalFouls)

t.test(totalfouls ~ COVID, data=refs)
```
```{r ttest2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

So again, start at the bottom. With Fans, refs called about 41 fouls per game. Without fans? More like 46. Without fans, the refs were calling MORE fouls. 

But is it significant?

Look at the p-value. It's 2.247e-15. Is that less than .05? Depends on if you can remember how to read scientific notation. What that says is the p-value is 2.247 x 10 to the -15 power. Not remembering negative exponents? Take the decimal point and move it 15 places to the left. So point then 14 zeros then 2247 or .000000000000002247. Is that less than .05? Yes. Yes it is.

That means we **reject the null hypothesis** that there is no difference between fans and no fans when it comes to the refs calling fouls in NBA games. They absolutely did call more fouls in the bubble without fans. Our hypothesis that the bubble affected refereeing is correct, but our supposition about it is not. I thought they'd back off. Instead, they called more. 

We're going to be analyzing these bubble games for *years* trying to find the true impact of fans.
