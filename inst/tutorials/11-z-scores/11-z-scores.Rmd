## The Goal

The goal of this lesson is to introduce you to z-scores, a powerful statistical tool for standardizing and comparing data across different groups or time periods. You'll learn what z-scores are, how they're calculated, and why they're particularly useful in sports analytics. We'll focus on using R to calculate z-scores for volleyball team performance, allowing us to compare teams across different seasons and conferences. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to use z-scores to create composite measures of performance, rank teams relative to their peers, and make meaningful comparisons that account for differences in competition levels or eras. You'll also learn how to interpret z-scores and communicate their meaning effectively to a non-technical audience. This skill will enable you to conduct more sophisticated analyses of team and player performance, helping you identify truly standout performances in their proper context.

## The Basics

Z-scores are a handy way to standardize numbers so you can compare things across groupings or time. In this class, we may want to compare teams by year, or era. We can use z-scores to answer questions like who was the greatest X of all time, because a z-score can put them in context to their era. 

A z-score is a measure of how far a particular stat is from the mean. It's measured in standard deviations from that mean. A standard deviation is a measure of how much variation -- how spread out -- numbers are in a data set. What it means here, with regards to z-scores, is that zero is perfectly average. If it's 1, it's one standard deviation above the mean, and 34 percent of all cases are between 0 and 1. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/simulations2.png"))
```

If you think of the normal distribution, it means that 84.3 percent of all case are below that 1. If it were -1, it would mean the number is one standard deviation below the mean, and 84.3 percent of cases would be above that -1. So if you have numbers with z-scores of 3 or even 4, that means that number is waaaaaay above the mean.  

So let's use the remarkable career of Nebraska volleyball legend and CoJMC alumna Lexi Rodriguez, which if you weren't paying attention, she was very good at volleyball. She finished her career breaking Nebraska's all-time digs record, overtaking another Nebraska legend Justine Wong-Orontes. In her senior season, Rodriquez was up for player of the year awards. But was it her best season as a Husker?

### Calculating a Z score in R

For this we'll need the season totals for the last four seasons. First, load the tidyverse.

```{r load-tidyverse, exercise=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-solution}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r load-tidyverse-check}
grade_this_code()
```

And load the data.

```{r zscore-load-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE}
seasons <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/ncaa_womens_volleyball_players_2124.csv")

perset <- seasons |> 
  mutate(
    digsperset = digs/s,
    acesperset = aces/s
  ) |>
  select(season, team, conference, name, digsperset, acesperset)

playerzscore <- perset |>
  group_by(season) |> 
  mutate(
    aceszscore = as.numeric(scale(acesperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    digszscore = as.numeric(scale(digsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    totalzscore = aceszscore + digszscore
  ) |> ungroup() 
```
```{r zscore-load-data-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
seasons <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/ncaa_womens_volleyball_players_2124.csv")
```
```{r zscore-load-data-exercise-solution}
seasons <- read_csv("https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/ncaa_womens_volleyball_players_2124.csv")
```
```{r zscore-load-data-exercise-check}
grade_this_code()
```

Let's `glimpse` the data and see what we've got. 

```{r glimpse-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
glimpse(seasons)
```
```{r glimpse-data-solution}
glimpse(seasons)
```
```{r glimpse-data-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 1: Preparing data

The first thing we need to do is create some metrics to deal with comparing seasons that deal with players playing different amounts. Then we'll select some fields we think represent a good libero and a few things to help us keep things straight. 

Every player plays a different number of sets in a season, and that has to do with how good you are and how good your team is. In volleyball, being on a really good team can mean playing *fewer* sets in a season, because you're just sweeping everyone. But then you get the NCAA tournament, and get more matches. So it's just a mess. To be able to work with this, we need to standardize around *per set* metrics. Sets in our data are marked as s. 

To get that, we're going to use mutate to create `digsperset` and `acesperset`. Then, we're going to use select to get season, team, conference and our metrics. 

```{r zscore2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
perset <- seasons |> 
  mutate(
    digsperset = ____/____,
    acesperset = ____/____
  ) |>
  select(season, team, conference, ____, ____)
```
```{r zscore2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
perset <- seasons |> 
  mutate(
    digsperset = digs/s,
    acesperset = aces/s
  ) |>
  select(season, team, conference, name, digsperset, acesperset)
```
```{r zscore2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2: Create a z-score

The first thing we're going to do is deal with having multiple seasons. We want the z-score to be centered on the average for *that season*, so each Husker gets ranked against their competition, not all players in all seasons. That way, we compare how good 2021 Lexi was compared to 2024 Lexi. Lexi from 2021 can't play a season of matches from 2024 or 2023 or 2022, so we can only compare her to her competition. How do we make z-scores for each season? Simple: group by. 

Then, we're *NOT* going to use summarize. We'll use mutate. That has the effect of putting all the 2020 teams together in a pile, calculating each teams z-score and then just leaving it there instead of folding it all together into a single number (like summarize would). 

To calculate a z-score in R, the easiest way is to use the `scale` function in base R. To use it, you use `scale(FieldName, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)`. The center and scale indicate if you want to subtract from the mean and if you want to divide by the standard deviation, respectively. We do.

When we have multiple z-scores, it's pretty standard practice to add them together into a composite score. That's what we're doing at the end here with `totalzscore`. 

```{r zscore3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
playerzscore <- perset |>
  group_by(____) |> 
  mutate(
    aceszscore = as.numeric(scale(____perset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    digszscore = as.numeric(scale(____perset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    totalzscore = ____zscore + ____zscore
  ) |> ungroup() 
```
```{r zscore3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
playerzscore <- perset |>
  group_by(season) |> 
  mutate(
    aceszscore = as.numeric(scale(acesperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    digszscore = as.numeric(scale(digsperset, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
    totalzscore = aceszscore + digszscore
  ) |> ungroup() 
```
```{r zscore3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

So now we have a dataframe called `playerzscore` that has all players from the 2021-2024 seasons with Z scores. What does it look like? 

```{r head-data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
head(playerzscore)
```
```{r head-data-solution}
head(playerzscore)
```
```{r head-data-check}
grade_this_code()
```

A way to interpret this data -- a player at zero is precisely average. The larger the positive number, the more exceptional they are. The larger the negative number, the more truly terrible they are (relative to all DI talent, which is orders of magnitude better than any of us). 

### Exercise 3: Arrange to the rescue

So who were the best players in the country over this time? Arrange can tell us. We just made a composite z-score -- a total if you will. Let's use that in arrange to see who is the best by our measure.

```{r zscore4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
playerzscore |> arrange(desc(____))
```
```{r zscore4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
playerzscore |> arrange(desc(totalzscore))
```
```{r zscore4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

And the greatest libero in the last four years is ... wait what? 

So we have some work to do here if this is the answer we're getting, but what if we look a little closer. 

### Exercise 4: Filtering to see Lexi

Obviously, competition matters, and we could do some filtering to get only Power Four teams in here and do it again. But we set out to ask which was Lexi's best season. So let's filter for it. 

```{r zscore5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "zscore-load-data"}
playerzscore |> 
  filter(name == "____") |> 
  arrange(desc(____)) |>
  select(season, name, totalzscore)
```
```{r zscore5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
playerzscore |> 
  filter(name == "Lexi Rodriguez") |> 
  arrange(desc(totalzscore)) |>
  select(season, name, totalzscore)
```
```{r zscore5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

So, as we can see, with our composite Z Score, the best Lexi isn't this year. It isn't even last year. It was 2021.

In 2024, breaking records and on the doorstep of Player of the Year, Lexi turned in her third best season, relative to competition. Huh.

## Writing about z-scores

The great thing about z-scores is that they make it very easy for you, the sports analyst, to create your own measures of who is better than who. The downside: Only a small handful of sports fans know what the hell a z-score is. 

As such, you should try as hard as you can to avoid writing about them. 

If the word z-score appears in your story or in a chart, you need to explain what it is. "The ranking uses a statistical measure of the distance from the mean called a z-score" is a good way to go about it. You don't need a full stats textbook definition, just a quick explanation. And keep it simple. 

**Never use z-score in a headline.** Write around it. Away from it. Z-score in a headline is attention repellent. You won't get anyone to look at it. So "Tottenham tops in z-score" bad, "Tottenham tops in the Premiere League" good.

## The Recap

In this lesson, we've explored the concept of z-scores and their application in sports analytics. We learned that z-scores provide a standardized measure of how far a data point is from the mean, expressed in terms of standard deviations. This allows us to compare performances across different seasons, leagues, or eras. We practiced calculating z-scores in R using the scale() function and applied this to volleyball player statistics. We created composite z-scores to rank players based on multiple performance metrics, demonstrating how this technique can provide insights that raw statistics alone might miss. However, we also encountered some unexpected results, highlighting the importance of critically evaluating our measures and considering additional context. We discussed the challenges of communicating z-scores to a general audience and strategies for presenting these insights effectively. Remember, while z-scores are a powerful tool for standardizing comparisons, they should be used in conjunction with other analytical methods and domain knowledge for comprehensive sports analysis. 

## Terms to Know

- Z-score: A statistical measure that indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.
- Standard Deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
- Normal Distribution: A probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.
- scale() function: An R function used to compute z-scores by centering and scaling numeric variables.
- Composite Z-score: A combined measure created by adding multiple individual z-scores together.
