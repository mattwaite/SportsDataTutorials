<h1>Building your own blog with blogdown</h1>
<div id="section-the-basics" class="section level2">
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>If you listen to the <a
href="https://www.measurablespod.com/podcast">Measurables Podcast</a>
for about two episodes, you’ll detect a pattern. The host asks each
guest how they got started in sports analytics. To a one, they’ll say
they found public data and started blogging about their analysis of it.
For nearly every single guest, this is their path into the field. They
started messing around with data in a toolset, found something
interesting and wrote a post about what they found and how they found
it. Other analysts noticed it, or a hiring manager liked what they read,
and the rest is history, as they say.</p>
<p>So, let’s do that. Let’s get you a blog so you can post your
work.</p>
<p>Here’s our requirements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>This doesn’t cost you anything.</li>
<li>There’s zero maintenance work or upkeep. No servers to manage. No
account to pay for.</li>
<li>Since you’re going to be writing about your code, you should be able
to create your blog posts in R Studio.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="section-setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>With those requirements in mind, we’re going to use a library called
Quarto, which supercharges R Markdown to make documents, websites, blogs
and books. It’s new, and growing, and you can do a lot with it.</p>
<p>You’ll first go to <a
href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/">Quarto’s website</a> and
wait just one moment before you do anything.</p>
<p>Before you install Quarto, you should close R Studio. So close R
Studio, install it, restart R Studio and come back to this tutorial.</p>
<p>After that, we’re ready to start making a blog. To do that, go to
File &gt; New Project and select New Directory (or Version Control if
you know what you’re doing).</p>
<p><img src="images/blog1.png" width="706" /></p>
<p>In the Project Type view, find “Quarto Blog”. Mine will probably look
different than yours, but below is what the line you’re looking for
looks like.</p>
<p><img src="images/blog2.png" width="537" /></p>
<p>Name the directory you’re going to put this into. Keep it simple.
Blog is fine. Then decide where on your computer you’re going to put it.
You should put this where you’ve been putting all your homework for this
class.</p>
<p><img src="images/blog3.png" width="1000" /></p>
<p>When you hit Create Project, you should get an R Studio screen. You
might have two files open – _quarto.yml and index.qmd. If you don’t,
open them (you can use the files pane in the bottom right). The
important one for now is _quarto.yml. This file will look different
depending on some choices you make.</p>
<p>The choices you need to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>The website title should be yours.</li>
<li>The Github account (more on this soon) and Twitter handles should be
yours.</li>
<li>If you want a custom favicon logo, you’ll have to include one. You
can ignore this for a while.</li>
<li>You should pick a <a
href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#themes">not-default
theme</a>. If you want to have themes for light and dark mode, the code
below handles that. If you want just one theme, the default code you get
in your _quarto.yml file does that.</li>
<li>Add the execute: freeze bits below to your file. This way, your code
only executes when you change it. This will become more important later
when you have multiple posts.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>project:

</div>
<div id="section-creating-a-post" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating a post</h2>
<p>Under the files tab on the lower right, you’ll see a folder named
posts. In there, you’ll find two folders with sample posts in them.
There’s not much to them, but they’re useful to look at before we delete
them.</p>
<p>To create a post, you’re going to first create a folder for it.
<strong>The folder name matters because it’s going to be part of your
url.</strong> For this to work your folder name has to do a couple of
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contain only lowercase letters and dashes instead of spaces. So My
Awesome Post will not work. It should be my-awesome-post.</li>
<li>Contain words that are in your post, and would be something people
would search for. If your post is about Nebraska women’s run into the
NCAA Tournament, make sure your post title and folder name contains
those words.</li>
<li>In other words, <strong>you need to think about what your post is
about before you make this folder</strong>. Can you change it later?
Yes. But the sooner you start focusing on a topic the better.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have created the folder, go to the button next to the
create folder button and create a Quarto Document. Name that document
index.qmd. <strong>DO NOT NAME IT CAPITAL I INDEX. IT’S LOWER CASE
I.</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/blog4.png" width="811" /></p>
<p>At the top, you will have something called a yaml header, which are
things that set up the page. They are quite simple to figure out. Here
is an example you should copy and edit for all of your posts.</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;CHANGE THIS TO BE THE TITLE OF YOUR POST&quot;
author: &quot;THIS IS YOUR NAME&quot;
date: &#39;2022-XX-XX&#39;
categories: [lowercaseword, lowercaseword, lowercaseword]
image: &quot;image.png&quot;
format: 
  html:
    code-fold: true
---</code></pre>
<p>For us, the cold-fold bit is important, and it is not standard. This
will allow users to see your code that makes your graphics, without
displaying it. Users can decide if they want to see the code.</p>
<p>Now that you have a folder and an index.qmd file with a proper yaml
header, you’re ready to write your post. This document works just the
same as any R Markdown file we’ve worked with all semester. Create text
between code blocks, and your code blocks will execute to produce
graphics.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-seeing-your-site" class="section level2">
<h2>Seeing your site</h2>
<p>While you are creating your site, you’re going to want to see it.
Quarto will spin up a web server on your computer and render your site
in a browser with a button. This will give you the chance to see what it
will look like when it is finally published. For this step, you want to
Preview your website.</p>
<p><img src="images/blog5.png" width="902" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-publishing-your-site" class="section level2">
<h2>Publishing your site</h2>
<p>Quarto static site generator. What that means is that Quarto is going
to take your Markdown files and create static html. What does static
html mean? It means there’s no server creating it on the fly – that’s
called dynamic html – so this can be hosted on the simplest of servers.
Simple means cheap or even free.</p>
<p>Publishing takes a lot of steps to get set up, but once it is, it’s
easy.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a GitHub account</strong></p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://GitHub.com/">GitHub</a> and sign up for an
account. NOTE: Your username will be part of your website address, and
you could potentially be sending this to employers. I’m sure
blaze420rryday has been your handle since middle school, but do you want
an employer to see that? My GitHub user name is mattwaite. See what I’m
getting at here?</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set up your website repository</strong></p>
<p>For the low low price of nothing, GitHub will host a website for you,
and we are going to take them up on that bargain. There’s several tricks
to getting this to work, but none of them are hard. They just require
you to be specific.</p>
<p>To start, you can click on the plus sign in the top right corner or
hit the green new button, depending on what your page looks like vs mine
(I’m reasonably active GitHub user, so mine will look different from
yours).</p>
<p><img src="images/blog7.png" width="596" /></p>
<p>In the create a new repository page, <strong>the name of your
respository needs to follow this pattern</strong>:
yourusernamehere.github.io where yourusernamehere is … your username. So
my site is mattwaite.github.io because my username is mattwaite. This is
why you do not want to select swaggylovedoctor as your username, no
matter how attached to it you are. Your employment chances are zero with
something dumb like that.</p>
<p>After you’ve named the repository correctly, leave it public, check
add .gitignore, and then select a gitignore template. Type R into the
search, select it, and the create repository button will become active.
Click create repository.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Don’t close your GitHub window.</p>
<p>In a new tab, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">download the
GitHub Desktop App</a> and install it.</p>
<p>GitHub is a version control system and a social network mixed
together. Version control is like Track Changes in Word, but on
steroids. If you plan on a career in analytics or data science, GitHub
is a skill you will have to learn, but it’s beyond the scope of this
book.</p>
<p>To work around this, we’re going to use GitHub Desktop to manage our
interactions with GitHub. Open GitHub Desktop and log into your GitHub
account in the app.</p>
<p>To get your repository into GitHub Desktop, go back to your tab with
your GitHub repository in it. Find the Code button and click it. Click
on the Open With GitHub Desktop button.</p>
<p>In the window that pops up, we need to set the Local Path.
<strong>This path needs to be the same place your blog project is
located.</strong> In other words, there needs to be a folder where you
have your Blog folder, and you’re going to put it in the containing
folder, <strong>NOT IN YOUR BLOG FOLDER</strong>. These two folders need
to be side by side with each other in the same folder.</p>
<p>Click the Choose button and navigate to the folder where your blog
project is located. Then, click Clone.</p>
<p><img src="images/blog9.png" width="316" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s get your site on the internet.</p>
<p>Switch back to your blog project in R Studio. We’re going to output
your site and upload it to GitHub.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to change _quarto.yml. We need to tell your
website project that you want to publish to your GitHub folder, not the
default.</p>
<p>Open _quarto.yml in your blog project. At the top, add this line,
replacing yourusername with … your user name. This says publish to your
GitHub project that you put in the same folder as your blog project:</p>
<pre><code>project:
  type: website
  output-dir: ../YOURUSERNAME.github.io</code></pre>
<p>Save _quarto.yml.</p>
<p>Once you are ready to build your site, you need to click on the
Render Website button.</p>
<p>If it worked, you should see output in the Background Jobs window,
which is in the same window as the Console.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
<p>Now go to the GitHub Desktop App. You should see something that looks
like this, though yours will be different from mine. The important part
is you see changes to commit.</p>
<p><img src="images/blog12.png" width="478" /></p>
<p>This is where you will commit files to your repository. GitHub is a
two-step process for getting files from your computer to GitHub. The
first is committing the files. To do that, add a message in the box next
to your avatar (where it says update index.html in the screenshot
above). Then click Commit to main (mine says master because it’s an
older repository before GitHub switched to using main by default). The
second step is to push it to GitHub. You do that on the screen that
appears after you have committed your files. It should say you have No
Local Changes, which is good because you sent them to GitHub. Now click
Push origin.</p>
<p><img src="images/blog13.png" width="477" /></p>
<p>In a few minutes, you should be able to go to username.github.io in a
browser and you’ll see your site. <a
href="http://mattwaite.github.io/">Here’s mine</a>.
